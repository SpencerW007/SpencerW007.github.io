<h3> Here is a list of every job I have ever had </h3>

<ul>
<li> Babysitter </li>
<li> Soccer Referee </li>
<li> Golf Instructor </li>
<li> Busser </li>
<li> Cashier </li>
<li> Social Media Marketer </li>
<li> Sandwich Maker </li>
<li> Brand Awareness Intern </li>
<li> Social Media Consulting Intern </li>
<li> Merchandise Planning and Allocation Intern </li>
</ul>

<p> Out of all of these jobs, my favorite was my most recent one of being an MP&A intern. I did this during the summer of 2022 
    out in Phoenix, Arizona. I really enjoyed it and got a return offer, so am going back full time at the end of the year. It 
    was at corporate <a href="https://www.petsmart.com/" class="nlink"> PetSmart</a>. I really liked the culture which is what is most important to me. Also, every day is bring your
    pet to work day, so there are dogs constantly in the office which makes it such a fun place to work at. Before PetSmart, I did
    a bunch of smaller internships and none of them really spoke to me. I worked for a few startups that gave me really good
    experience, but I didn't truly enjoy the work. I also realized I didn't want to necessarily start my own business after working
    at some startups because of the truly exhausting amount of work it entails and how unsuccessful they are. I have also done some 
    easier jobs for pocket money such as working at a sandwich store and bussing tables at a restaurant.
