<h3 class="educationH"> Before High School</h3>
<p>
 I went to elementary school at <a href="https://www.parkhillelementary.org/" class="nlink"> Park Hill Elementary</a> which is located in Denver. I was there from kindergarten through 5th grade. 
 After that, I went to <a href="https://dcis.dpsk12.org/" class="nlink">DCIS</a> for middle school which is an abbreviation of Denvcer Center for International Studies. This was 
 mainly a language school where I spent one year learning Lakota and another year learning Italian. I went here for 6th and 
 7th grade. At the end of my 7th grade, I was told I could skip 8th grade because of my grades and test scores. So I skipped 
 8th grade and went straight to highschool.
</p> 

<h3 class="educationH"> High School </h3>
<p>
    After middle school, I went to highschool at <a href="https://east.dpsk12.org/" class="nlink"> Denver East High School</a> located in central Denver. While I was there,
    I was mainly studying engineeirng courses such as AP calculus BC, AP physics, and AP chemistry. However, once I entered my
    senior year, I realized I really didn't enjoy these courses so met with my counselor. After that, I decided to switch to 
    business classes such as accounting, AP statistics, and social media marketing. I enjoyed these classes a lot more and 
    tried out DECA which is a business club of sorts. I went to state after my first year doing it. From here, I realized I
    wanted to do business as a college degree. I applied to the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/business/" class="nlink">CU Leeds School of Business</a> and got in which has led me to 
    where I am today.
</p>

<h3 class="educationH"> College </h3>
<p>
When I got to college I knew I wanted to do business, but was unsure about what emphasis. I started with entrepreneurship and
marketing. But I quickly realized I was more into the creative side of marketing and not the research side. So I applied for
creative technology and design (CTD) minor to focus on the creative side of marketing that I enjoy. I also interned at startup
which made me decide I didn't enjoy the entrepreneurship journey as much as I thought I would've. From here I was unsure what
I wanted to do. Sophomore year I took the business modules - short 8 week courses that do a quick run of different emphasises of
business. After this, I realized I enjoyed operations management and information management. I decided to major in these two 
areas, and then added a third major of business analytics because it had a lot of similarities with the other two. I also found
out that there was a business of sports certificate, and I am a huge sports fan - especially soccer. I applied for this and 
got in, so decided to add that to my list of things to study. That leads me to today where I am finsishing up my senior year
and then going out to Phoenix for a job as a merchant trainiee.
