<h3> Here is a list of my hobbies </h3>
<ol>
<li> Sports - I am a massive soccer fan. I watch the premier league every Saturday morning. My two teams are Manchester United and
    the Wolverhampton Wanderers. My dad is from Wolverhampton which is why I follow that team and why I am a fan of soccer in 
    general. I have also played soccer my entire life and still play to this day. Other sports I play and follow include basketball,
    football, and spikeball (if you count that). </li>

<li> Photography - I have always been into photography since I was little and my dad let me use his fancy camera. I then got 
     a nice Canon camera of my own for Christmas in high school and got really into taking pictures. My favorite things to take 
     photos of are animals and nature. Being in Colorado makes taking pictures of animals really easy. We have deer and foxes
     constantly in our backyard. My favorite vacation was when I went to Alaska because of the amount of animals and natural beauty.
     Taking pictures of sunsets and sunrises are also one of my favorite things to do. </li>

<li> Hanging out with friends - I know this one seems cliche, but I really do enjoy being around my friends. I am currently
    living with my best friends which makes hanging with them very easy. We do all sorts of things together including playing
    sports, wathcing movies, going out to bars, going on vacation, going hiking, playing video games, and the list could go on
    forever. One of my favorite memories was when we went to Lake Havasu City in Arizona for Spring Break. We took a minvan with 
    6 people and did a 13 hour road trip. The car ride was super fun and the actual trip itself was very memorable.  </li>

<li> Working out - I have gotten pretty serious about working out recently. I try to go to the gym 5 times a week. I also completed 75 hard 
    which is a mental and physical challenge. The challenge is: Every day, for 75 days, you have to follow a strict diet with no 
    cheat meals, drink a gallon of water, workout twice including one outdoor workout, and read 10 pages of a book.
    After doing that challenge, I got more invested in working out. </li>

<li> Music - I used to play the piano when I was younger, but then I stopped playing when I got too busy, but I have wanted to get 
    back into it recently. I might buy a piano when I move out to Arizona. Apart from playing music, I really enjoy listening to music
    and making playlists to listen to later. I have a wide variety of music I listen to from classical piano, to pop, to rap, to alternative
    rock, to EDM, and more. </li>
</ol>
